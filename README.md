# ü™ê Real-Time Solar System Viewer

## ‚ú® Description

A real-time, interactive 3D solar system viewer built with the Three.js library. This application simulates the orbital positions of the planets around the Sun, allowing users to explore our solar system in a dynamic visual environment.

## üöÄ Features

* **3D Visualization:** Renders the Sun and the eight major planets in a captivating three-dimensional space.

* **Orbital Motion:** Planets realistically orbit the Sun, with their speeds approximated based on their actual orbital periods to showcase their relative movements.

* **Interactive Camera:** Easily navigate the solar system by dragging your mouse to rotate the view and using your scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

* **Responsive Design:** The application dynamically adjusts its display to fit various browser window sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

You can access the live application directly in your web browser:

## üíª Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.

* **CSS3:** For styling and ensuring a full-screen, dark background for the space theme.

* **JavaScript:** The core logic for planet calculations and interactions.

* **Three.js (r128):** A powerful JavaScript 3D library used for rendering the solar system.

* **OrbitControls.js:** A Three.js addon for intuitive camera controls (rotation and zooming).

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* **Add Moons and Rings:** Incorporate Earth's Moon, Jupiter's Galilean moons, and Saturn's rings for greater detail and realism.

* **Accurate Ephemeris Data:** Integrate a more precise ephemeris data source or calculation method for highly accurate planetary positions.

* **Texture Mapping:** Apply high-resolution textures to the planets and the Sun to enhance visual fidelity.

* **Information Display:** Add interactive elements to display detailed information about each planet upon selection.

* **Starfield Background:** Create a dynamic starfield to provide a more immersive space environment.

* **Time Control:** Introduce controls to speed up, slow down, or jump to specific dates in the simulation.
